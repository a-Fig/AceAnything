        question="What does California's \"Basic Speed Law\" require drivers to do?",

            "Always drive at the posted speed limit.",
            "Always match the speed of surrounding traffic."
        ],
        explanation="California's Basic Speed Law (CVC 22350) mandates that a driver must never operate their vehicle faster than is safe for the prevailing conditions, irrespective of the posted speed limit. Factors like weather (rain, fog, ice), visibility, traffic volume, road surface, and road design (curves, hills) dictate the safe speed. Driving the posted limit might be unsafe and illegal if conditions are hazardous. You can receive a speeding ticket for violating the Basic Speed Law even if driving below the posted speed limit if conditions warrant a slower speed. For example, going 65 mph on a freeway during dense fog or heavy rain could be deemed unsafe. The law requires using good judgment and adjusting speed for darkness, curves, traffic, weather, or any hazards."

        explanation="Unless a different speed limit is posted, the default (prima facie) speed limit in California business and residential districts is 25 mph. This reduced speed is necessary due to increased pedestrian activity, vehicles entering/exiting driveways and parking spots, and other potential hazards common in these areas."

It must be kept in the trunk. If the vehicle has no trunk, it may be kept in some other area of the vehicle not normally occupied by the driver or passengers (e.g., bed of a pickup).

        explanation="Deliberately fleeing or attempting to evade a law enforcement officer is a serious crime. If someone is seriously injured during a police chase caused by a driver's attempt to escape, California law (Vehicle Code Â§ 2800.3) makes it a felony punishable by imprisonment in state prison for three, five, or seven years, or by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, and by a fine.
